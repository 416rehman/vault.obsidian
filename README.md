# Obsidian Vault

This repository contains the structure of how I organize my notes, drawings, kanboards, and canvases in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I use Obsidian to take notes on a variety of topics and for project management.

The following directories are used in this repository:

  * `.obsidian (default)` - This directory contains the configured plugins and settings for Obsidian.
  * `_obsidian` - This directory contains other folders that are used by Obsidian.
  * `_obsidian/_attachments` - This directory contains all the attachments that are linked to in the notes.
  * `_obsidian/_templates` - This directory contains templates that are used by different plugins, such as Excalidraw and Kanban.
  * `Drawings`* - This directory contains all the drawings that are created in Excalidraw.
  * `Notes` - This directory contains all the markdown notes.
  * `Boards` - This directory is for all the kanban boards and canvases.

**Note:** Each excalidraw `.md` file automatically creates a corresponding `.svg` file that is then embedded into the excalidraw `.md` file so the drawn contents are visible natively when the `.md` file is rendered outside Obsidian (such as in Github).
